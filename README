This is the source code for the "hello world" OpenGL application described in
chapter 2 of Joe Groff's OpenGL tutorial: 

http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Chapter-2:-Hello-World:-The-Slideshow.html

You will need SDL 1.2 <http://www.libsdl.org/> to compile this program. It
also requires OpenGL 2.0 or later.

Do whatever you like with this source code.
